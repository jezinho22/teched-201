			Change the css position for One, Two and Three to 'absolute' and
			then make them into 3 boxes side by side by changing top, bottom,
			right and left. See if you can make them all the same size and
			distribute them equally. Can you make them into chunks of text?
			<br />
			The parent div is 600px wide and so it's possible to calculate
			instead of guessing. Though I ended up guessing a bit when I did
			this. <br />
			Remember that you have to control all four sides of the block, and
			make them appropriate distances from the top, bottom, left and right
			edges of the parent.
