          the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
          industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
          printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
          book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
          electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
          popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
          containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
          publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
