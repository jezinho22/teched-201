In fact new things I actually learned:   
- how to move a directory ( I forgot the git part of git mv)
- how to create a profile page for my github
- how to make a folder in a repo (foldername / anyfile)
- the difference between events, event listeners and event handlers (eg mouse click, onclick, and function buttonClicked())

## IWTFO   

- more about why people don't like js so much - I have found it quite liberating after VBA and Python
- more about colours and predicting what hexes will render as
- how to make a profile page look really cool
