// As a user, I would like to view a series of data related to the site owners interest

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a ‚ÄúTop Ten‚Äù at the bottom of your HTML page as an ordered list in HTML.
// Some ideas that you can include could be top ten movies, top ten favorite places,
// or top ten places to visit. You may choose to do whatever top ten list that you wish.
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Convert your work experience and education summary into an unordered list using HTML

// As a user, I would like to be guided to an answer through a series of feedback responses
// so that I can learn more about the site owner.
// 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add a 6th question to the guessing game that takes in a numeric input by prompting the user
// to guess a number.
// - Indicates through an alert if the guess is ‚Äútoo high‚Äù or ‚Äútoo low‚Äù.
// - It should give the user exactly four opportunities to get the correct answer.
// - After all attempts have been exhausted, tell the user the correct answer. Consider using a loop of some sort.

// As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities
// so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.
// 4Ô∏è‚É£ Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
// - Give the user 6 attempts to guess the correct answer.
// - The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
// - Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
// - Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.

// As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.
// 5Ô∏è‚É£ Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct
// out of the 7 questions asked.
// 6Ô∏è‚É£ Using Lighthouse in the Chrome DevTools, analyze the accessibility of your application.

// - Strive for a score between 50-65. Make necessary adjustments based on the report to achieve that score.
// - Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md file.

// - In addition to the user stories stated above, continue to use console.logs throughout the code to
//  track the questions that are being asked to the user, and add addtional CSS to style your HTML page.
// - Stay within scope of what was taught so far in class.
// - Do not write functions within your application.
// - Avoid the use of ‚Äúhelper‚Äù methods such as .includes() and .join().

// Stretch Goals
// After completing all of the requirements listed above, you may optionally challenge yourself further
// by implementing some or all of the following into your application.

// 1Ô∏è‚É£ Attempt to make your code more DRY by putting all of the questions, answers, and responses
// to the first five yes/no questions into arrays (or even one huge multidimensional array),
// and modifying the game logic such that a ‚Äòfor‚Äô loop will control the flow from question to question.
// 2Ô∏è‚É£ Make the number-guessing question use a random number as its correct answer.
