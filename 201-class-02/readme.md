### TIL
- Huh! You can put little % operators on CSS and adjust them so that elements are x% the size of each other
- Which would make it easy to to create a loading bar, or percent correct bar - which is just what I need for my cricket picking game
- I also learned how to make multiple folders and files in terminal eg `mkdir 201-class-{01..15}` and `touch ~/projects/teched-201/201-class-{01..15}/readme.md`

### IWTFOMA
- How to use selectors dynamically for CSS
- I've forgotten how to do numbered list in md - I thought it was just with numbers ...
