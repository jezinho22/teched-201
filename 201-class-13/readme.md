Looking forward to finding out about local storage and json. I tried to look at
it when I stopped evenings because it was a bit I really wanted to know more
about. But in fact I want to know more about server storage. I fiddled with
stringify when trying to collect together a load of code snippets into a data
object - I hoped it would help me manage quote marks, but it didn't. I used
loads of approaches and ended up creating the object, editing line by line until
I had something with quote marks in the right pairs. I still want to know about
server storage
