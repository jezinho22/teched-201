		<h3>JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Expert Group image</h3>
		<p>It has quite a few suffixes: .jpg, .jpeg, .jfif, .pjpeg, .pjp</p>
		<p>
			It is very widely used and well-established as a format, and when it
			first came out it represented a huge step change in file size
			compared to bitmaps. However, it reduces file-size by "losing"
			information, and so jpgs can lose details that you might want to
			keep.
		</p>
		<p>
			Use it for photos of holidays to send to people who won't want to
			print them. Use it for profile pictures that are small anyway.
		</p>
		<p>
			Don't use it for things that require detail - things that people may
			wnat to print and display, or refer to in fine detail, like pictures
			of text, screenshots.
